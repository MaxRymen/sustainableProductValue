Notes

Improvement opportunities:
- Non nego 1: did not have full time to check how calculations happen at the moment, but they do not work yet, some things are hardcoded etc. so totals do not add up (we just need to spend the time to set that up) this needs to be consistent to be able to give demo'<s></s>
- Idea 1: I think for a demo, it would be great if we can have an easy log-in page, where as a company you can have your own dashboard of your products, do your analysis, save them and have a results table with list prices, target price and floor price (which you could theoretically extract and upload in your ERP system)
- Idea 2: for the demo, (even if just 'fake'), I would like to show sources a bit more with the analysis - e.g., based on this market research, your internal slack data, google drive and ...
- Idea 3: Ideally, we start from segments rather than having that as a later steps - I have ideas on this, but believe they will complexify some things so to be seen if we already want to add them
- Idea 4: Eventually, I believe it makes sense to split up the different parts of the analysis and assess together how we can best perform them (it will not be by just sending a prompt to Chat GPT, but might be sufficient for demo)
-> this is where things become fun @Valentin - interesting insights to be generated, API's to be set-up, workflows created, etc.
- Idea 5: Many of our users will not be experts in pricing - I would love for the tool to guide them more in how to make decisions in this space (what is an NBA, what is a value driver, how to figure out more)
- Idea 6: The insight will give ranges based on research, but eventually we will need to let user make decisions - e.g., the price of these competitors is between 100-120, what would you use?
